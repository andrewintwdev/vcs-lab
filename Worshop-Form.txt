▶▶ Aesthetic Programming Workshop | A Brief Introduction to Versioning and Forking ◀◀

VAM is heading to Taichung to host a workshop!

Aesthetic Programming is an open access book that explores the cultural, aesthetic, and political dimensions of programming from within programming languages themselves. It encourages readers to “write code as if writing literature, and write literature as if writing code.”

In this workshop, members of the Taiwan edition working group of Aesthetic Programming will guide participants in a beginner-friendly way through the book’s core technical practices: versioning and forking. Drawing on the spirit of forking in software engineering, we’ll introduce how the book itself is openly licensed to allow everyone to freely modify and reuse it.

Whether you are a creator, researcher, or activist interested in the intersections of technology and culture, you’re welcome to join us in exploring how Aesthetic Programming reimagines the possibilities of coding and writing.
